## Problem Statement 
William Macfarlane wants to look at an array.

You are given a list of N numbers and Q queries. Each query is specified by two numbers i and j; the answer to each query is the sum of every number between the range [i, j] (inclusive).

Note: the query ranges are specified using 0-based indexing.

### Format

Input
The first line contains N, the number of integers in our list (N <= 100,000). The next line holds N numbers that are guaranteed to fit inside an integer. Following the list is a number Q (Q <= 10,000). The next Q lines each contain two numbers i and j which specify a query you must answer (0 <= i, j <= N-1).

Output
For each query, output the answer to that query on its own line in the order the queries were made.
