// PROBLEM STATEMENT

Theofanis has a riddle for you and if you manage to solve it, he will give you a Cypriot snack halloumi for free (Cypriot cheese).

You are given an integer n. You need to find two integers l and r such that −1018≤l<r≤1018 and l+(l+1)+…+(r−1)+r=n.

Input
The first line contains a single integer t (1≤t≤104) — the number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1≤n≤1018).

Output
For each test case, print the two integers l and r such that −10^18≤l<r≤10^18 and l+(l+1)+…+(r−1)+r=n.

It can be proven that an answer always exists. If there are multiple answers, print any.
